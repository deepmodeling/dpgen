 | From the input file and the structure file we know the number of   |

 | information for each element, especially the zeta and polar atomic |
 | orbital number for each element. The total atom number is counted. |
 | We calculate the nearest atom distance for each atom and show the  |
 | Cartesian and Direct coordinates for each atom. We list the file   |
 | address for atomic orbitals. The volume and the lattice vectors    |
 | in real and reciprocal space is also shown.                        |

 | The pseudopotential file is in UPF format. The 'NC' indicates that |
 | the type of pseudopotential is 'norm conserving'. Functional of    |
 | exchange and correlation is decided by 4 given parameters in UPF   |
 | file.  We also read in the 'core correction' if there exists.      |
 | Also we can read the valence electrons number and the maximal      |
 | angular momentum used in this pseudopotential. We also read in the |
 | trail wave function, trail atomic density and local-pseudopotential|
 | on logrithmic grid. The non-local pseudopotential projector is also|
 | read in if there is any.                                           |
