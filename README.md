## About DP-GEN
DP-GEN (Deep Generator)  is a software written in Python, delicately designed to generate a deep learning based model of interatomic potential energy and force field. DP-GEN is depedent on DeepMD-kit (https://github.com/deepmodeling/deepmd-kit/blob/master/README.md). With highly scalable interface with common softwares for molecular simulation, DP-GEN is capable to  automatically prepare scripts and maintain job queues on HPC machines (High Performance Cluster) and analyze results
### Highlighted features
+ **Accurate and efficient**: DP-GEN is capable to sample more than tens of million structures and select only a few for first principles calculation. DP-GEN will finally obtain a uniformly accurate model.
+ **User-friendly and automatic**: Users may install and run DP-GEN easily. Once succusefully running, DP-GEN can dispatch and handle all jobs on HPCs, and thus there's no need for any personal effort.
+ **Highly scalable**: With modularized code structures, users and developers can easily extend DP-GEN for their most relevant needs. DP-GEN currently supports for HPC systems (Slurm, PBS, LSF and cloud machines ), Deep Potential interface with DeePMD-kit, MD interface with LAMMPS  and *ab-initio* calculation interface with VASP, PWSCF, SIESTA, and Gaussian. We're sincerely welcome and embraced to users' contributions, with more possibilities and cases to use DP-GEN.

## Init: Preparing Initial Data

### Init_bulk

You may prepare initial data for bulk systems with VASP by:

```bash
dpgen init_bulk PARAM MACHINE
```

Basically `init_bulk` can be devided into four parts , denoted as `stages` in `PARAM`:
1. Relax in folder `00.place_ele`
2. Pertub and scale in folder `01.scale_pert`
3. Run a shor AIMD in folder `02.md`
4. Collect data in folder `02.md`.

All stages must be **in order**. One doesn't need to run all stages. For example, you may run stage 1 and 2, generating supercells as starting point of exploration in `dpgen run`.

Following is an example for `PARAM`, which generates data from a typical structure hcp.
```json
{
    "stages" : [1,2,3,4],
    "cell_type":    "hcp",
    "latt":     4.479,
    "super_cell":   [2, 2, 2],
    "elements":     ["Mg"],
    "potcars":      ["....../POTCAR"],
    "relax_incar": "....../INCAR_metal_rlx",
    "md_incar" : "....../INCAR_metal_md",
    "scale":        [1.00],
    "skip_relax":   false,
    "pert_numb":    2,
    "md_nstep" : 5,
    "pert_box":     0.03,
    "pert_atom":    0.01,
    "coll_ndata":   5000,
    "_comment":     "that's all"
}
```

If you want to specify a structure as starting point for `init_bulk`, you may set in `PARAM` as follows.

```json
"from_poscar":	true,
"from_poscar_path":	"....../C_mp-47_conventional.POSCAR",
```
The following table gives explicit descriptions on keys in `PARAM`.

The bold notation of key (such as **Elements**) means that it's a necessary key.

 Key  | Type          | Example                                                      | Discription                                                      |

### Init_surf

You may prepare initial data for surface systems with VASP by:

```bash
dpgen init_surf PARAM MACHINE
```

Basically `init_surf` can be devided into two parts , denoted as `stages` in `PARAM`:
1. Build specific surface in folder `00.place_ele`
2. Pertub and scale in folder `01.scale_pert`

All stages must be **in order**.

Following is an example for `PARAM`, which generates data from a typical structure hcp.
```json

    1,
    2
  ],
  "cell_type": "fcc",

## Run: Main Process of Generator


You may call the main process by:
`dpgen run PARAM MACHINE`.


The whole process of generator will contain a series of iterations, succussively undertaken in order such as heating the system to certain temperature.

In each iteration, there are three stages of work, namely, `00.train  01.model_devi  02.fp`.

+ 00.train: DP-GEN will train several (default 4) models based on initial and generated data. The only difference between these models is the random seed for neural network initialization.

+ 01.model_devi : represent for model-deviation. DP-GEN will use models obtained from 00.train to run Molecular Dynamics(default LAMMPS). Larger deviation for structure properties (default is force of atoms) means less accuracy of the models. Using this criterion, a few fructures will be selected and put into next stage `02.fp` for more accurate calculation based on First Principles.

+ 02.fp : Selected structures will be calculated by first principles methods(default VASP). DP-GEN will obtain some new data and put them together with initial data and data generated in previous iterations. After that a new training will be set up and DP-GEN will enter next iteration!

DP-GEN identifies the current stage by a record file, `record.dpgen`, which will be created and upgraded by codes.Each line contains two number: the first is index of iteration, and the second ,ranging from 0 to 9 ,records which stage in each iteration is currently running.

0,1,2 correspond to make_train, run_train, post_train. DP-GEN will write scripts in `make_train`, run the task by specific machine in `run_train` and collect result in `post_train`. The records for model_devi and fp stage follow similar rules.


In `PARAM`, you can specialize the task as you expect.

## Test: Auto-test for Deep Generator
At this step, we assume that you have prepared some graph files like `graph.*.pb` and the particular pseudopotential `POTCAR`.

The main code of this step is
```
dpgen test PARAM MACHINE
```
where `PARAM` and `MACHINE` are both json files. `MACHINE` is the same as above.

The whole program contains a series of tasks shown as follows. In each task, there are three stages of work, generate, run and compute.
+ `00.equi`:(default task) the equilibrium state

+ `01.eos`: the equation of state

+ `02.elastic`: the elasticity like Young's module

+ `03.vacancy`: the vacancy formation energy

+ `04.interstitial`: the interstitial formation energy

+ `05.surf`: the surface formation energy


We take Al as an example to show the parameter settings of `param.json`.
The first part is the fundamental setting for particular alloy system.
```json
    "_comment": "models",
    "potcar_map" : {
	"Al" : "/somewhere/POTCAR"
    },
    "conf_dir":"confs/Al/std-fcc",
    "key_id":"API key of Material project",
    "task_type":"deepmd",
    "task":"eos",
```
You need to add the specified paths of necessary `POTCAR` files in "potcar_map". The different `POTCAR` paths are separated by commas.
Then you also need to add the folder path of particular configuration, which contains `POSCAR` file.
```
"confs/[element or alloy]/[std-* or mp-**]"
std-*: standard structures, * can be fcc, bcc, hcp and so on.
mp-**: ** means Material id from Material Project.
```
Usually, if you add the relative path of POSCAR as the above format,
`dpgen test` will check the existence of such file and automatically downloads the standard and existed configurations of the given element or alloy from Materials Project and stores them in **confs** folder, which needs the API key of Materials project.

+ `task_type` contains 3 optional types for testing, i.e. **vasp**, **deepmd** and **meam**.
+ `task` contains 7 options, **equi**, **eos**, **elastic**, **vacancy**, **interstitial**, **surf** and **all**. The option **all** can do all the tasks.

It is worth noting that the subsequent tasks need to rely on the calculation results of the equilibrium state, so it is necessary to give priority to the calculation of the equilibrium state while testing. And due to the stable consideration, we recommand you to test the equilibrium state of **vasp** before other tests.

The second part is the computational settings for vasp and lammps. The most important setting is to add the folder path `model_dir` of **deepmd** model and supply the corresponding element type map. Besides, `dpgen test` also is able to call common lammps packages, such as **meam**.
```json
"vasp_params":	{
	"ecut":		650,
	"ediff":	1e-6,
	"kspacing":	0.1,
	"kgamma":	false,
	"npar":		1,
	"kpar":		1,
	"_comment":	" that's all "
    },
    "lammps_params":    {
        "model_dir":"somewhere/example/Al_model",
        "type_map":["Al"],
        "model_name":false,
        "model_param_type":false
    },
```
The last part is the optional settings for various tasks mentioned above. You can change the parameters according to actual needs.
```json
    "_comment":"00.equi",
    "store_stable":true,
```
+ `store_stable`:(boolean) whether to store the stable energy and volume

```json
    "_comment": "01.eos",
    "vol_start":	12,
    "vol_end":		22,
    "vol_step":		0.5,
```
+ `vol_start`, `vol_end` and `vol_step` determine the volumetric range and accuracy of the **eos**.

```json
    "_comment": "02.elastic",
    "norm_deform":	2e-2,
    "shear_deform":	5e-2,
```
+ `norm_deform` and `shear_deform` are the scales of material deformation.
This task uses the stress-strain relationship to calculate the elastic constant.

```json
    "_comment":"03.vacancy",
    "supercell":[3,3,3],
```
+ `supercell`:(list of integer) the supercell size used to generate vacancy defect and interstitial defect
```json
    "_comment":"04.interstitial",
    "insert_ele":["Al"],
    "reprod-opt":false,
```
+ `insert_ele`:(list of string) the elements used to generate point interstitial defect
+ `repord-opt`:(boolean) whether to reproduce trajectories of interstitial defect

```json
    "_comment": "05.surface",
    "min_slab_size":	10,
    "min_vacuum_size":	11,
    "_comment": "pert xz to work around vasp bug...",
    "pert_xz":		0.01,
    "max_miller": 2,
    "static-opt":false,
    "relax_box":false,
```
+ `min_slab_size` and `min_vacuum_size` are the minimum size of slab thickness  and  the vacuume width.
+ `pert_xz` is the perturbation through xz direction used to compute surface energy.
+ `max_miller` (integer) is the maximum miller index
+ `static-opt`:(boolean) whether to use atomic relaxation to compute surface energy. if false, the structure will be relaxed.
+ `relax_box`:(boolean) set true if the box is relaxed, otherwise only relax atom positions.




## Set up machine
When switching into a new machine, you may modifying the `MACHINE`, according to the actual circumstance. Once you have finished, the `MACHINE` can be re-used for any DP-GEN tasks without any extra efforts.

## Troubleshooting
1. The most common problem is whether two settings correspond with each other, including:
    - The order of elements in `type_map` and `mass_map` and **`fp_pp_files`**.
    - Size of `init_data_sys` and `init_batch_size`.
    - Size of `sys_configs` and `sys_batch_size`.
    - Size of `sel_a` and actual types of atoms in your system.
    - Index of `sys_configs` and `sys_idx`

2. Please verify the directories of `sys_configs`. If there isnt's any POSCAR for `01.model_devi` in one iteration, it may happen that you write the false path of `sys_configs`.
3. Correct format of JSON file. 
4. In `02.fp`, total cores you require through `task_per_node` should be devided by `npar` times `kpar`.
5. The frames of one system should be larger than `batch_size` and `numb_test` in `default_training_param`. It happens that one iteration adds only a few structures and causes error in next iteration's training. In this condition, you may let `fp_task_min` be larger than `numb_test`.
