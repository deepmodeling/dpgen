DP-GEN (Deep Generator)  is a software written in Python, delicately designed to generate a deep learning based model of interatomic potential energy and force field. DP-GEN is dependent on [DeepMD-kit](https://github.com/deepmodeling/deepmd-kit/blob/master/README.md). With highly scalable interface with common softwares for molecular simulation, DP-GEN is capable to  automatically prepare scripts and maintain job queues on HPC machines (High Performance Cluster) and analyze results.

If you use this software in any publication, please cite:

### Code structure and interface
+ dpgen:
    * data: source codes for preparing initial data of bulk and surf systems.

    * generator: source codes for main process of deep generator.

    * auto_test : source code for undertaking materials property analysis.
    * remote and dispatcher : source code for automatically submitting scripts,maintaining job queues and collecting results.
    Notice this part has been integrated into [dpdispatcher](https://github.com/deepmodeling/dpdispatcher) 
    * database : source code for collecting data generated by DP-GEN and interface with database.
+ examples : providing example JSON files.

+ tests : unittest tools for developers.

One can easily run DP-GEN with :
```
dpgen TASK PARAM MACHINE
```

where TASK is the key word, PARAM and MACHINE are both JSON files.

Options for TASK:
* `init_bulk` : Generating initial data for bulk systems.
* `init_surf` : Generating initial data for surface systems.
* `run` : Main process of Deep Generator.
* `autotest`: Autotest for Deep Potential.
* `db`: Collecting data from DP-GEN.


[Here](examples) are examples you can refer to. You should make sure that provide a correct [JSON](https://docs.python.org/3/library/json.html) file.
You can use following command to check your JSON file.
```python
import json
#Specify machine parameters in machine.json
json.load(open("machine.json"))
```

## Download and Install
One can download the source code of dpgen by
```bash
git clone https://github.com/deepmodeling/dpgen.git
```
then you may install DP-GEN easily by:
```bash
cd dpgen
pip install --user .
```
With this command, the dpgen executable is install to `$HOME/.local/bin/dpgen`. You may want to export the `PATH` by
```bash
export PATH=$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH
```
To test if the installation is successful, you may execute
```bash
dpgen -h
```


## Init: Preparing Initial Data

### Init_bulk

You may prepare initial data for bulk systems with VASP by:

```bash
dpgen init_bulk PARAM [MACHINE]
```
The MACHINE configure file is optional. If this parameter exists, then the optimization
tasks or MD tasks will be submitted automatically according to MACHINE.json.

Basically `init_bulk` can be divided into four parts , denoted as `stages` in `PARAM`:
1. Relax in folder `00.place_ele`
2. Perturb and scale in folder `01.scale_pert`
3. Run a short AIMD in folder `02.md`
4. Collect data in folder `02.md`.

All stages must be **in order**. One doesn't need to run all stages. For example, you may run stage 1 and 2, generating supercells as starting point of exploration in `dpgen run`.

If MACHINE is None, there should be only one stage in stages. Corresponding tasks will be generated, but user's intervention should be involved in, to manually run the scripts.

Following is an example for `PARAM`, which generates data from a typical structure hcp.
```json
{
    "stages" : [1,2,3,4],
    "cell_type":    "hcp",
    "latt":     4.479,
    "super_cell":   [2, 2, 2],
    "elements":     ["Mg"],
    "potcars":      ["....../POTCAR"],
    "relax_incar": "....../INCAR_metal_rlx",
    "md_incar" : "....../INCAR_metal_md",
    "scale":        [1.00],
    "skip_relax":   false,
    "pert_numb":    2,
    "md_nstep" : 5,
    "pert_box":     0.03,
    "pert_atom":    0.01,
    "coll_ndata":   5000,
    "type_map" : [ "Mg", "Al"],
    "_comment":     "that's all"
}
```

If you want to specify a structure as starting point for `init_bulk`, you may set in `PARAM` as follows.

```json
"from_poscar":	true,
"from_poscar_path":	"....../C_mp-47_conventional.POSCAR",
```
`init_bulk` support both VASP and ABACUS for first-principle calculation. You can choose the software by specifying the key `init_fp_style`. If `init_fp_style` is not specified, the default software will be VASP. 

When using ABACUS for `init_fp_style`, the keys of the paths of `INPUT` files for relaxation and MD simulations are the same as `INCAR` for VASP, which are `relax_incar` and `md_incar` respectively. Use `relax_kpt` and `md_kpt` for the relative path for `KPT` files of relaxation and MD simulations. They two can be omitted if `kspacing` (in unit of 1/Bohr) or `gamma_only` has been set in corresponding INPUT files. If `from_poscar` is set to `false`, you have to specify `atom_masses` in the same order as `elements`.

The following table gives explicit descriptions on keys in `PARAM`.

The bold notation of key (such as **Elements**) means that it's a necessary key.

 Key  | Type          | Example                                                      | Description                                                      |

| latt | Float | 4.479 | Lattice constant for single cell.
| from_poscar | Boolean | True | Deciding whether to use a given poscar as the beginning of relaxation. If it's true, keys (`cell_type`, `latt`) will be aborted. Otherwise, these two keys are **necessary**.
| from_poscar_path | String | "....../C_mp-47_conventional.POSCAR" | Path of POSCAR for VASP or STRU for ABACUS. **Necessary** if `from_poscar` is true.
| relax_incar | String | "....../INCAR" | Path of INCAR for VASP or INPUT for ABACUS for relaxation in VASP. **Necessary** if `stages` include 1.
| md_incar | String |  "....../INCAR" | Path of INCAR for VASP or INPUT for ABACUS for MD in VASP. **Necessary** if `stages` include 3.|
| **scale** | List of float | [0.980, 1.000, 1.020] | Scales for transforming cells.

| **pert_box** | Float | 0.03 | Percentage of Perturbation for cells.
| **pert_atom** | Float | 0.01 | Perturbation of each atoms (Angstrom).
| **md_nstep** | Integer | 10 | Steps of AIMD in stage 3. If it's not equal to settings via `NSW` in `md_incar`, DP-GEN will follow `NSW`.
| **coll_ndata** | Integer | 5000 | Maximal number of collected data.
| type_map | List | [ "Mg", "Al"] | The indices of elements in deepmd formats will be set in this order.
| init_fp_style | String | "ABACUS" or "VASP" | First-principle software. If this key is absent, the default value will be "VASP".

| md_kpt | String | "....../KPT" | Path of `KPT` file for MD simulations in stage 3. Only useful if `init_fp_style` is "ABACUS".
| atom_masses | List of float | [24] | List of atomic masses of elements. The order should be the same as `Elements`. Only useful if `init_fp_style` is "ABACUS".

### Init_surf

You may prepare initial data for surface systems with VASP by:

```bash
dpgen init_surf PARAM [MACHINE]
```
The MACHINE configure file is optional. If this parameter exists, then the optimization
tasks or MD tasks will be submitted automatically according to MACHINE.json.

Basically `init_surf` can be divided into two parts , denoted as `stages` in `PARAM`:
1. Build specific surface in folder `00.place_ele`
2. Perturb and scale in folder `01.scale_pert`

All stages must be **in order**.

Following is an example for `PARAM`, which generates data from a typical structure fcc.
```json
{
  "stages": [
    1,
    2
  ],
  "cell_type": "fcc",
  "latt": 4.034,
  "super_cell": [
    2,
    2,
    2
  ],
  "layer_numb": 3,
  "vacuum_max": 9,
  "vacuum_resol": [
    0.5,
    1
  ],
  "mid_point": 4.0,
  "millers": [
    [
      1,
      0,
      0
    ],
    [
      1,
      1,
      0
    ],
    [
      1,
      1,
      1
    ]
  ],
  "elements": [
    "Al"
  ],
  "potcars": [
    "....../POTCAR"
  ],
  "relax_incar": "....../INCAR_metal_rlx_low",
  "scale": [
    1.0
  ],
  "skip_relax": true,
  "pert_numb": 2,
  "pert_box": 0.03,
  "pert_atom": 0.01,
  "_comment": "that's all"
}
```

Another example is `from_poscar` method. Here you need to specify the POSCAR file. 

```
{
  "stages": [
    1,
    2
  ],
  "cell_type": "fcc",
  "from_poscar":	true,
  "from_poscar_path":	"POSCAR",
  "super_cell": [
    1,
    1,
    1
  ],
  "layer_numb": 3,
  "vacuum_max": 5,
  "vacuum_resol": [0.5,2],
  "mid_point": 2.0,
  "millers": [
    [
      1,
      0,
      0
    ]
  ],
  "elements": [
    "Al"
  ],
  "potcars": [
    "./POTCAR"
  ],
  "relax_incar" : "INCAR_metal_rlx_low",
  "scale": [
    1.0
  ],
  "skip_relax": true,
  "pert_numb": 5,
  "pert_box": 0.03,
  "pert_atom": 0.01,
  "coll_ndata": 5000,
  "_comment": "that's all"
}
```

## Run: Main Process of Generator


You may call the main process by:
`dpgen run PARAM MACHINE`.


The whole process of generator will contain a series of iterations, successively undertaken in order such as heating the system to certain temperature.

In each iteration, there are three stages of work, namely, `00.train  01.model_devi  02.fp`.

+ 00.train: DP-GEN will train several (default 4) models based on initial and generated data. The only difference between these models is the random seed for neural network initialization.

+ 01.model_devi : represent for model-deviation. Model-deviation engine in `01.model_devi` can be chosen between Molecular Dynamics(LAMMPS and GROMACS) or Structures Prediction(CALYPSO). DP-GEN will use models obtained from 00.train to run Molecular Dynamics or to run structure optimization with ASE in CALYPSO. Larger deviation for structure properties (default is force of atoms) means less accuracy of the models. Using this criterion, a few structures will be selected and put into next stage `02.fp` for more accurate calculation based on First Principles.

+ 02.fp : Selected structures will be calculated by first principles methods(default VASP). DP-GEN will obtain some new data and put them together with initial data and data generated in previous iterations. After that a new training will be set up and DP-GEN will enter next iteration!

DP-GEN identifies the current stage by a record file, `record.dpgen`, which will be created and upgraded by codes.Each line contains two number: the first is index of iteration, and the second ,ranging from 0 to 9 ,records which stage in each iteration is currently running.

0,1,2 correspond to make_train, run_train, post_train. DP-GEN will write scripts in `make_train`, run the task by specific machine in `run_train` and collect result in `post_train`. The records for model_devi and fp stage follow similar rules.


In `PARAM`, you can specialize the task as you expect.

#### Rules for cp2k input at dictionary form
   Converting cp2k input is very simple as dictionary used to dpgen input. You just need follow some simple rule:
- kind section parameter must be provide
- replace `keyword` in cp2k as `keyword` in dict.
- replace `keyword parameter` in cp2k as `value` in dict.
- replace `section name` in cp2k as `keyword` in dict. . The corresponding value is a `dict`.
- replace `section parameter` in cp2k as `value` with dict. keyword `"_"`
- `repeat section` in cp2k just need to be written once with repeat parameter as list. 

If you want to use your own parameter, just write a corresponding dictionary. The `COORD` section will be filled by dpgen automatically, therefore do not include this in dictionary. The `OT` or `Diagonalization` section is require for semiconductor or metal system. For specific example, have a look on `example` directory.

Here are examples for setting:
 ```python

 #minimal information you should provide for input
 #other we have set other parameters in code, if you want to
 #use your own paramter, just write a corresponding dictionary
 "user_fp_params":   {
     "FORCE_EVAL":{
         "DFT":{
             "BASIS_SET_FILE_NAME": "path",
             "POTENTIAL_FILE_NAME": "path",
             "SCF":{
                 "OT":{ "keyword":"keyword parameter", "keyword2":"keyword parameter" }
             }
         }
         "SUBSYS":{
             "KIND":{
                 "_": ["N","C","H"],
                 "POTENTIAL": ["GTH-PBE-q5","GTH-PBE-q4", "GTH-PBE-q1"],
                 "BASIS_SET": ["DZVP-MOLOPT-GTH","DZVP-MOLOPT-GTH","DZVP-MOLOPT-GTH"]
             }
         }
     }
 }
 ```

See Full example template.inp and dpgen input parameter file in 

`tests/generator/cp2k_make_fp_files/exinput/template.inp` and `tests/generator/param-mgo-cp2k-exinput.json`

     }
```

the following essential section should be provided in user template

```

## Autotest: Autotest for Deep Generator
Suppose that we have a potential (can be DFT, DP, MEAM ...), `autotest` helps us automatically calculate M properties on N configurations. The folder where the `autotest` runs is called the working directory of `autotest`. Different potentials should be tested in different working directories.

A property is tested in three steps: `make`, `run` and `post`. `make` prepares all computational tasks that are needed to calculate the property. For example to calculate EOS, `make` prepares a series of tasks, each of which has a scaled configuration with certain volume, and all necessary input files necessary for starting a VASP, ABACUS, or LAMMPS calculations. `run` sends all the computational tasks to remote computational resources defined in a machine configuration file like `machine.json`, and automatically collects the results when remote calculations finish. `post` calculates the desired property from the collected results.

### Relaxation

The relaxation of a structure should be carried out before calculating all other properties:
```bash
dpgen autotest make relax.json
dpgen autotest run relax.json machine.json
dpgen autotest post relax.json
```
If, for some reasons, the main program terminated at stage `run`, one can easily restart with the same command.
`relax.json` is the parameter file. An example for `deepmd` relaxation is given as:
```json
{
        "structures":   "confs/mp-*",
        "interaction": {
                "type":         "deepmd",
                "model":        "frozen_model.pb",
                "type_map":     {"Al": 0, "Mg": 1}
        },
        "relaxation": {}
}
```

where the key `structures` provides the structures to relax. `interaction` is provided with `deepmd`, and other options are `vasp`, `abacus`, `meam`...

### Task type

There are now six task types implemented in the package: `vasp`, `abacus`, `deepmd`, `meam`, `eam_fs`, and `eam_alloy`. An `inter.json` file in json format containing the interaction parameters will be written in the directory of each task after `make`. We give input examples of the `interaction` part for each type below:

**VASP**: 
    
The default of `potcar_prefix` is "".
```json
	"interaction": {
		"type":		"vasp",
		"incar":	"vasp_input/INCAR",
		"potcar_prefix":"vasp_input",
		"potcars":	{"Al": "POTCAR.al", "Mg": "POTCAR.mg"}
	}
```
**ABACUS**: 
    
The default of `potcar_prefix` is "". The path of potcars/orb_files/deepks_desc is `potcar_prefix` + `potcars`/`orb_files`/`deepks_desc`.
```json
	"interaction": {
		"type":		"abacus",
		"incar":	"abacus_input/INPUT",
		"potcar_prefix":"abacus_input",

### Property type

Now the supported property types are `eos`, `elastic`, `vacancy`, `interstitial`, `surface`, and `gamma`. Before property tests, `relaxation` should be done first or the relaxation results should be present in the corresponding directory `confs/mp-*/relaxation/relax_task`. A file named `task.json` in json format containing the property parameter will be written in the directory of each task after `make` step. Multiple property tests can be performed simultaneously.

### Below we start to introduce the relaxation, property, refine, and reproduce calculations in `autotest` in details.

### Relaxation calculations

The relaxation of a structure should be carried out before calculating all other properties. 

First, we need input parameter file and we name it `relax.json` here. All the relaxation calculations should be taken either by `VASP`, `ABACUS`, or `LAMMPS`. Here are two input examples for `VASP` and `LAMMPS` respectively. 

An example of the input file for relaxation by VASP:

```json
{
    "structures":            ["confs/std-*"],
    "interaction": {
            "type":           "vasp",
            "incar":          "vasp_input/INCAR",
            "potcar_prefix":  "vasp_input",
            "potcars":       {"Al": "POTCAR.al"}
	},
    "relaxation": {
            "cal_type":       "relaxation",
            "cal_setting":   {"relax_pos":       true,
                              "relax_shape":     true,
                              "relax_vol":       true,
                              "ediff":           1e-6,
                              "ediffg":         -0.01,
                              "encut":           650,
                              "kspacing":        0.1,
                              "kgamma":          false}
	}
}
```

                           "maximal": 500000}
	}
}
```

Three steps for property calculations are also `make`, `run`, and `post`.

### Refine the calculation of a property

Sometimes we want to refine the calculation of a property from previous results. For example, when higher convergence criteria `EDIFF` and `EDIFFG` are necessary in VASP, the new VASP calculation is desired to start from the previous output configuration, rather than starting from scratch. 


An example of the input file `refine.json` is given below:

```json
{
    "structures":       ["confs/std-*"],
    "interaction": {
        "type":          "deepmd",
        "model":         "frozen_model.pb",
        "type_map":     {"Al": 0}
    },
    "properties": [
        {
        "type":             "vacancy",
        "init_from_suffix": "00",
        "output_suffix":    "01",
        "cal_setting":     {"input_prop":  "lammps_input/lammps_high"}
        }
        ]
}
```
In this example, `refine` would output the results to `vacancy_01` based on the previous results in `vacancy_00` by using a different input commands file for lammps.

Three steps for refine calculations are also `make`, `run`, and `post`.

### Reproduce the calculation of a property

Sometimes we want to reproduce the initial results with the same configurations for cross validation. This version of autotest package can accomplish this successfully in all property types except for `Elastic`. An input example for using `deepmd` to reproduce the `VASP` Interstitial results is given below:

```json
{
    "structures":       ["confs/std-*"],
    "interaction": {
        "type":          "deepmd",
        "model":         "frozen_model.pb",
        "type_map":     {"Al": 0}
    },
    "properties": [
        {
        "type":             "interstitial",
        "reproduce":        true,
        "init_from_suffix": "00",
        "init_data_path":   "../vasp/confs",
        "reprod_last_frame":       false
        }
        ]
}
```

`reproduce` denotes whether to do `reproduce` or not and the default value is False. 

`init_data_path` is the path of VASP or LAMMPS initial data to be reproduced. `init_from_suffix` is the suffix of the initial data and the default value is "00". In this case, the VASP Interstitial results are stored in `../vasp/confs/std-*/interstitial_00` and the reproduced Interstitial results would be in `deepmd/confs/std-*/interstitial_reprod`. 

`reprod_last_frame` denotes if only the last frame is used in reproduce. The default value is True for eos and surface, but is False for vacancy and interstitial.

Three steps for reproduce calculations are also `make`, `run`, and `post`.

## Simplify
When you have a dataset containing lots of repeated data, this step will help you simplify your dataset. The workflow contains three stages: train, model_devi, and fp. The train stage and the fp stage are as the same as the run step, and the model_devi stage will calculate model deviations of the rest data that has not been confirmed accurate. Data with small model deviations will be confirmed accurate, while the program will pick data from those with large model deviations to the new dataset.

Use the following script to start the workflow:
```bash
dpgen simplify param.json machine.json
```

Here is an example of `param.json` for QM7 dataset:
```json

Here `pick_data` is the directory to data to simplify where the program recursively detects systems `System` with `deepmd/npy` format. `init_pick_number` and `iter_pick_number` are the numbers of picked frames. `e_trust_lo`, `e_trust_hi` mean the range of the deviation of the frame energy, and `f_trust_lo` and `f_trust_hi` mean the range of the max deviation of atomic forces in a frame. `fp_style` can only be `gaussian` currently. Other parameters are as the same as those of generator.


## Set up machine
### new dpdispatcher update note
dpdispatcher Update Note: 
dpdispatcher has updated and the api of `machine.json` is changed.
dpgen will use new dpdispatcher if the key `api_version` in dpgen's `machine.json`'s value is equal or large than `1.0`.

And dpgen will use old dpdispatcher if the key `api_version` is not specified in `machine.json` or the `api_version` is smaller than `1.0`.
This guarantees that the old `machine.json`s still work.

And for now dpdispatcher is maintained on a separate repo. 
The repo link: https://github.com/deepmodeling/dpdispatcher

The api of new dpdispatcher is close to old one except for a few changes. 

The new `machine.json` examples can be seen [here](https://docs.deepmodeling.org/projects/dpdispatcher/en/latest/getting-started.html)

And Here are the explanations of the keys in [machine](https://docs.deepmodeling.org/projects/dpdispatcher/en/latest/machine.html)
[resources](https://docs.deepmodeling.org/projects/dpdispatcher/en/latest/resources.html).


Here is a example `machine.json` for dpgen's new dpdispatcher.
Please check the [documents](https://deepmd.readthedocs.io/projects/dpdispatcher/en/latest/) for more information about new dpdispatcher.

note1: the key "local_root" in dpgen's machine.json is always `./`

## Troubleshooting
1. The most common problem is whether two settings correspond with each other, including:
    - The order of elements in `type_map` and `mass_map` and **`fp_pp_files`**.
    - Size of `init_data_sys` and `init_batch_size`.
    - Size of `sys_configs` and `sys_batch_size`.
    - Size of `sel_a` and actual types of atoms in your system.
    - Index of `sys_configs` and `sys_idx`

2. Please verify the directories of `sys_configs`. If there isn't any POSCAR for `01.model_devi` in one iteration, it may happen that you write the false path of `sys_configs`.
3. Correct format of JSON file.
4. In `02.fp`, total cores you require through `task_per_node` should be divided by `npar` times `kpar`.
5. The frames of one system should be larger than `batch_size` and `numb_test` in `default_training_param`. It happens that one iteration adds only a few structures and causes error in next iteration's training. In this condition, you may let `fp_task_min` be larger than `numb_test`.
