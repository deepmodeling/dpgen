DP-GEN (Deep Potential GENerator) is a software written in Python, delicately designed to generate a deep learning based model of interatomic potential energy and force field. DP-GEN is dependent on [DeePMD-kit](https://github.com/deepmodeling/deepmd-kit/). With highly scalable interface with common softwares for molecular simulation, DP-GEN is capable to  automatically prepare scripts and maintain job queues on HPC machines (High Performance Cluster) and analyze results.

## Highlighted features
+ **Accurate and efficient**: DP-GEN is capable to sample more than tens of million structures and select only a few for first principles calculation. DP-GEN will finally obtain a uniformly accurate model.
+ **User-friendly and automatic**: Users may install and run DP-GEN easily. Once successfully running, DP-GEN can dispatch and handle all jobs on HPCs, and thus there's no need for any personal effort.
+ **Highly scalable**: With modularized code structures, users and developers can easily extend DP-GEN for their most relevant needs. DP-GEN currently supports for HPC systems ([Slurm](https://slurm.schedmd.com/), [PBS](https://www.openpbs.org/), LSF and cloud machines), Deep Potential interface with DeePMD-kit, MD interface with [LAMMPS](https://www.lammps.org/), [Gromacs](http://www.gromacs.org/), [AMBER](https://ambermd.org/), Calypso and *ab-initio* calculation interface with [VASP](https://www.vasp.at/), [PWSCF](https://www.quantum-espresso.org/), [CP2K](https://www.cp2k.org/), [SIESTA](https://departments.icmab.es/leem/siesta/), [Gaussian](https://gaussian.com/), Abacus, [PWmat](http://www.pwmat.com/), etc. We're sincerely welcome and embraced to users' contributions, with more possibilities and cases to use DP-GEN.

## Download and Install

DP-GEN only supports Python 3.9 and above. You can use one of the following methods to install DP-GEN:

- Install via pip: `pip install dpgen`
- Install via conda: `conda install -c conda-forge dpgen``
- Install from source code: `git clone https://github.com/deepmodeling/dpgen && pip install ./dpgen`

To test if the installation is successful, you may execute

```bash
dpgen -h
```
