DP-GEN (Deep Generator)  is a software written in Python, delicately designed to generate a deep learning based model of interatomic potential energy and force field. DP-GEN is dependent on [DeepMD-kit](https://github.com/deepmodeling/deepmd-kit/blob/master/README.md). With highly scalable interface with common softwares for molecular simulation, DP-GEN is capable to  automatically prepare scripts and maintain job queues on HPC machines (High Performance Cluster) and analyze results.

## Init: Preparing Initial Data

### Init_bulk

You may prepare initial data for bulk systems with VASP by:

```bash
dpgen init_bulk PARAM [MACHINE]
```
The MACHINE configure file is optional. If this parameter exists, then the optimization
tasks or MD tasks will be submitted automatically according to MACHINE.json.

Basically `init_bulk` can be devided into four parts , denoted as `stages` in `PARAM`:
1. Relax in folder `00.place_ele`
2. Pertub and scale in folder `01.scale_pert`
3. Run a shor AIMD in folder `02.md`
4. Collect data in folder `02.md`.

All stages must be **in order**. One doesn't need to run all stages. For example, you may run stage 1 and 2, generating supercells as starting point of exploration in `dpgen run`.

If MACHINE is None, there should be only one stage in stages. Corresponding tasks will be generated, but user's intervention should be involved in, to manunally run the scripts.

Following is an example for `PARAM`, which generates data from a typical structure hcp.
```json
{
    "stages" : [1,2,3,4],
    "cell_type":    "hcp",
    "latt":     4.479,
    "super_cell":   [2, 2, 2],
    "elements":     ["Mg"],
    "potcars":      ["....../POTCAR"],
    "relax_incar": "....../INCAR_metal_rlx",
    "md_incar" : "....../INCAR_metal_md",
    "scale":        [1.00],
    "skip_relax":   false,
    "pert_numb":    2,
    "md_nstep" : 5,
    "pert_box":     0.03,
    "pert_atom":    0.01,
    "coll_ndata":   5000,
    "type_map" : [ "Mg", "Al"],
    "_comment":     "that's all"
}
```

If you want to specify a structure as starting point for `init_bulk`, you may set in `PARAM` as follows.

```json
"from_poscar":	true,
"from_poscar_path":	"....../C_mp-47_conventional.POSCAR",
```
`init_bulk` support both VASP and ABACUS for first-principle calculation. You can choose the software by specifying the key `init_fp_style`. If `init_fp_style` is not specified, the default software will be VASP. 

When using ABACUS for `init_fp_style`, the keys of the paths of `INPUT` files for relaxation and MD simulations are the same as `INCAR` for VASP, which are `relax_incar` and `md_incar` respectively. You have to additionally specify `relax_kspacing` and `md_kspacing` for k points spacing, and dpgen will automatically generate `KPT` files according to them. You may also use `relax_kpt` and `md_kpt` instead of them for the relative path for `KPT` files of relaxation and MD simulations. However, either `relax_kspacing` and `md_kspacing`, or `relax_kpt` and `md_kpt` is needed. If `from_poscar` is set to `false`, you have to specify `atom_masses` in the same order as `elements`.

The following table gives explicit descriptions on keys in `PARAM`.

The bold notation of key (such as **Elements**) means that it's a necessary key.

 Key  | Type          | Example                                                      | Discription                                                      |

| md_incar | String |  "....../INCAR" | Path of INCAR for VASP or INPUT for ABACUS for MD in VASP. **Necessary** if `stages` include 3.|
| **scale** | List of float | [0.980, 1.000, 1.020] | Scales for transforming cells.

| atom_masses | List of float | [24] | List of atomic masses of elements. The order should be the same as `Elements`. Only useful if `init_fp_style` is "ABACUS".

### Init_surf

You may prepare initial data for surface systems with VASP by:

```bash
dpgen init_surf PARAM [MACHINE]
```
The MACHINE configure file is optional. If this parameter exists, then the optimization
tasks or MD tasks will be submitted automatically according to MACHINE.json.

Basically `init_surf` can be devided into two parts , denoted as `stages` in `PARAM`:
1. Build specific surface in folder `00.place_ele`
2. Pertub and scale in folder `01.scale_pert`

All stages must be **in order**.

Following is an example for `PARAM`, which generates data from a typical structure hcp.
```json
{
  "stages": [
    1,
    2
  ],
  "cell_type": "fcc",
  "latt": 4.034,
  "super_cell": [
    2,
    2,
    2
  ],
  "layer_numb": 3,
  "vacuum_max": 9,
  "vacuum_resol": [
    0.5,
    1
  ],
  "mid_point": 4.0,
  "millers": [
    [
      1,
      0,
      0
    ],
    [
      1,
      1,
      0
    ],
    [
      1,
      1,
      1
    ]
  ],
  "elements": [
    "Al"
  ],
  "potcars": [
    "....../POTCAR"
  ],
  "relax_incar": "....../INCAR_metal_rlx_low",
  "scale": [
    1.0
  ],
  "skip_relax": true,
  "pert_numb": 2,
  "pert_box": 0.03,
  "pert_atom": 0.01,
  "_comment": "that's all"
}
```

Another example is `from_poscar` method. Here you need to specify the POSCAR file. 

```
{
  "stages": [
    1,
    2
  ],
  "cell_type": "fcc",
  "from_poscar":	true,
  "from_poscar_path":	"POSCAR",
  "super_cell": [
    1,
    1,
    1
  ],
  "layer_numb": 3,
  "vacuum_max": 5,
  "vacuum_resol": [0.5,2],
  "mid_point": 2.0,
  "millers": [
    [
      1,
      0,
      0
    ]
  ],
  "elements": [
    "Al"
  ],
  "potcars": [
    "./POTCAR"
  ],
  "relax_incar" : "INCAR_metal_rlx_low",
  "scale": [
    1.0
  ],
  "skip_relax": true,
  "pert_numb": 5,
  "pert_box": 0.03,
  "pert_atom": 0.01,
  "coll_ndata": 5000,
  "_comment": "that's all"
}
```

The following table gives explicit descriptions on keys in `PARAM`.

The bold notation of key (such as **Elements**) means that it's a necessary key.

 Key  | Type          | Example                                                      | Discription                                                      |

## Run: Main Process of Generator


You may call the main process by:
`dpgen run PARAM MACHINE`.


The whole process of generator will contain a series of iterations, succussively undertaken in order such as heating the system to certain temperature.

In each iteration, there are three stages of work, namely, `00.train  01.model_devi  02.fp`.

+ 00.train: DP-GEN will train several (default 4) models based on initial and generated data. The only difference between these models is the random seed for neural network initialization.

+ 01.model_devi : represent for model-deviation. Model-deviation engine in `01.model_devi` can be chosen between Molecular Dynamics(default LAMMPS) or Structures Prediction(default CALYPSO). DP-GEN will use models obtained from 00.train to run Molecular Dynamics or to run structures optimization with ASE in CALYPSO. Larger deviation for structure properties (default is force of atoms) means less accuracy of the models. Using this criterion, a few fructures will be selected and put into next stage `02.fp` for more accurate calculation based on First Principles.

+ 02.fp : Selected structures will be calculated by first principles methods(default VASP). DP-GEN will obtain some new data and put them together with initial data and data generated in previous iterations. After that a new training will be set up and DP-GEN will enter next iteration!

DP-GEN identifies the current stage by a record file, `record.dpgen`, which will be created and upgraded by codes.Each line contains two number: the first is index of iteration, and the second ,ranging from 0 to 9 ,records which stage in each iteration is currently running.

0,1,2 correspond to make_train, run_train, post_train. DP-GEN will write scripts in `make_train`, run the task by specific machine in `run_train` and collect result in `post_train`. The records for model_devi and fp stage follow similar rules.


In `PARAM`, you can specialize the task as you expect.

The following table gives explicit descriptions on keys in `PARAM`.

The bold notation of key (such aas **type_map**) means that it's a necessary key.

 Key  | Type          | Example                                                      | Discription                                                      |

#### Rules for cp2k input at dictionary form
   Converting cp2k input is very simple as dictionary used to dpgen input. You just need follow some simple rule:
- kind section parameter must be provide
- replace `keyword` in cp2k as `keyword` in dict.
- replace `keyword parameter` in cp2k as `value` in dict.
- replace `section name` in cp2k as `keyword` in dict. . The corresponding value is a `dict`.
- repalce `section parameter` in cp2k as `value` with dict. keyword `"_"`
- `repeat section` in cp2k just need to be written once with repeat parameter as list. 

If you want to use your own paramter, just write a corresponding dictionary. The `COORD` section will be filled by dpgen automatically, therefore do not include this in dictionary. The `OT` or `Diagonalization` section is require for semiconductor or metal system. For specific example, have a look on `example` directory.

Here are examples for setting:
 ```python

 #minimal information you should provide for input
 #other we have set other parameters in code, if you want to
 #use your own paramter, just write a corresponding dictionary
 "user_fp_params":   {
     "FORCE_EVAL":{
         "DFT":{
             "BASIS_SET_FILE_NAME": "path",
             "POTENTIAL_FILE_NAME": "path",
             "SCF":{
                 "OT":{ "keyword":"keyword parameter", "keyword2":"keyword parameter" }
             }
         }
         "SUBSYS":{
             "KIND":{
                 "_": ["N","C","H"],
                 "POTENTIAL": ["GTH-PBE-q5","GTH-PBE-q4", "GTH-PBE-q1"],
                 "BASIS_SET": ["DZVP-MOLOPT-GTH","DZVP-MOLOPT-GTH","DZVP-MOLOPT-GTH"]
             }
         }
     }
 }
 ```

#### Rules for use cp2k template input provided by user

See Full example template.inp and dpgen input parameter file in 

`tests/generator/cp2k_make_fp_files/exinput/template.inp` and `tests/generator/param-mgo-cp2k-exinput.json` 

Here is example for provide external input

```python
    {
    "_comment":     " 02.fp ",
     "fp_style":     "cp2k",
     "shuffle_poscar":   false,
     "fp_task_max":  100,
     "fp_task_min":  10,
     "fp_pp_path":   ".",
     "fp_pp_files":  [],
     "external_input_path": "./cp2k_make_fp_files/exinput/template.inp",
     "_comment":     " that's all 
     }
```

the following essential section should be provided in user template

```

 &FORCE_EVAL
   # add this line if you need to fit virial
   STRESS_TENSOR ANALYTICAL
   &PRINT
     &FORCES ON
     &END FORCES
     # add this line if you need to fit virial
     &STRESS_TENSOR ON
     &END FORCES
   &END PRINT
   &SUBSYS

     &END COORD
   &END SUBSYS
&END FORCE_EVAL
```

## Test: Auto-test for Deep Generator
###  configure and param.json
At this step, we assume that you have prepared some graph files like `graph.*.pb` and the particular pseudopotential `POTCAR`.

The main code of this step is
```
dpgen test PARAM MACHINE
```
where `PARAM` and `MACHINE` are both json files. `MACHINE` is the same as above.

The whole program contains a series of tasks shown as follows. In each task, there are three stages of work, generate, run and compute.
+ `00.equi`:(default task) the equilibrium state

+ `01.eos`: the equation of state

+ `02.elastic`: the elasticity like Young's module

+ `03.vacancy`: the vacancy formation energy

+ `04.interstitial`: the interstitial formation energy

+ `05.surf`: the surface formation energy

Dpgen auto_test will auto make dir for each task it tests, the dir name is the same as the dir name. And the test results will in a plain text file named result. For example `cat ./01.eos/Al/std-fcc/deepmd/result`


We take Al as an example to show the parameter settings of `param.json`.
The first part is the fundamental setting for particular alloy system.
```json
    "_comment": "models",
    "potcar_map" : {
	"Al" : "/somewhere/POTCAR"
    },
    "conf_dir":"confs/Al/std-fcc",
    "key_id":"API key of Material project",
    "task_type":"deepmd",
    "task":"eos",
```

You need to add the specified paths of necessary `POTCAR` files in "potcar_map". The different `POTCAR` paths are separated by commas.
Then you also need to add the folder path of particular configuration, which contains `POSCAR` file.
```
"confs/[element or alloy]/[std-* or mp-**]"
std-*: standard structures, * can be fcc, bcc, hcp and so on.
mp-**: ** means Material id from Material Project.
```
Usually, if you add the relative path of POSCAR as the above format,
`dpgen test` will check the existence of such file and automatically downloads the standard and existed configurations of the given element or alloy from Materials Project and stores them in **confs** folder, which needs the API key of Materials project.

+ `task_type` contains 3 optional types for testing, i.e. **vasp**, **deepmd** and **meam**.
+ `task` contains 7 options, **equi**, **eos**, **elastic**, **vacancy**, **interstitial**, **surf** and **all**. The option **all** can do all the tasks.

It is worth noting that the subsequent tasks need to rely on the calculation results of the equilibrium state, so it is necessary to give priority to the calculation of the equilibrium state while testing. And due to the stable consideration, we recommand you to test the equilibrium state of **vasp** before other tests.

The second part is the computational settings for vasp and lammps. According to your actual needs， you can choose to add the paths of specific INCAR or use the simplified INCAR by setting `vasp_params`. The priority of specified INCAR is higher than using `vasp_params`. The most important setting is to add the folder path `model_dir` of **deepmd** model and supply the corresponding element type map. Besides, `dpgen test` also is able to call common lammps packages, such as **meam**.
```json

"vasp_params":	{

    },
```
The last part is the optional settings for various tasks mentioned above. You can change the parameters according to actual needs.

### The content of the auto_test
To know what actually will dpgen autotest do, including the lammps and vasp script, the input file and atom configuration file auto_test will generate, please refer to https://hackmd.io/@yeql5ephQLaGJGgFgpvIDw/rJY1FO92B

## Simplify
When you have a dataset containing lots of repeated data, this step will help you simplify your dataset. The workflow contains three stages: train, model_devi, and fp. The train stage and the fp stage are as the same as the run step, and the model_devi stage will calculate model deviations of the rest data that has not been confirmed accurate. Data with small model deviations will be confirmed accurate, while the program will pick data from those with large model deviations to the new dataset.

Use the following script to start the workflow:
```bash
dpgen simplify param.json machine.json
```

Here is an example of `param.json` for QM7 dataset:

Here `pick_data` is the data to simplify and currently only supports `MultiSystems` containing `System` with `deepmd/npy` format, and `use_clusters` should always be `true`. `init_pick_number` and `iter_pick_number` are the numbers of picked frames. `e_trust_lo`, `e_trust_hi` mean the range of the deviation of the frame energy, and `f_trust_lo` and `f_trust_hi` mean the range of the max deviation of atomic forces in a frame. `fp_style` can only be `gaussian` currently. Other parameters are as the same as those of generator.


## Set up machine
### new dpdispatcher update note
dpdispatcher Update Note: 
dpdispatcher has updated and the api of `machine.json` is changed.
dpgen will use new dpdispatcher if the key `api_version` in dpgen's `machine.json`'s value is equal or large than `1.0`.

And dpgen will use old dpdispatcher if the key `api_version` is not specified in `machine.json` or the `api_version` is smaller than `1.0`.
This gurantees that the old `machine.json`s still work.

And for now dpdispatcher is maintained on a seperate repo. 
The repo link: https://github.com/deepmodeling/dpdispatcher

The api of new dpdispatcher is close to old one except for a few changes. 

The new `machine.json` examples can be seen [here](https://docs.deepmodeling.org/projects/dpdispatcher/en/latest/getting-started.html)

And Here are the explanations of the keys in [machine](https://docs.deepmodeling.org/projects/dpdispatcher/en/latest/machine.html)
[resources](https://docs.deepmodeling.org/projects/dpdispatcher/en/latest/resources.html).


Here is a example `machine.json` for dpgen's new dpdispatcher.
Please check the [documents](https://deepmd.readthedocs.io/projects/dpdispatcher/en/latest/) for more information about new dpdispatcher.

note1: the key "local_root" in dpgen's machine.json is always `./`

### old dpdispatcher

When switching into a new machine, you may modifying the `MACHINE`, according to the actual circumstance. Once you have finished, the `MACHINE` can be re-used for any DP-GEN tasks without any extra efforts.

An example for `MACHINE` is:
```json

Following table illustrates which key is needed for three types of machine: `train`,`model_devi`  and `fp`. Each of them is a list of dicts. Each dict can be considered as an independent environmnet for calculation.

 Key   | `train`          | `model_devi`                                                    | `fp`                                                     |
| :---------------- | :--------------------- | :-------------------------------------- | :-------------------------------------------------------------|
| machine | NEED  | NEED | NEED
| resources | NEED | NEED | NEED
| command | NEED  |NEED |  NEED  
| group_size | NEED | NEED | NEED |

The following table gives explicit descriptions on keys in param.json.


 Key   | Type       | Example                                                  | Discription                                                     |
| :---------------- | :--------------------- | :-------------------------------------- | :-------------------------------------------------------------|
| machine | Dict | | Settings of the machine for TASK.
| resources | Dict | | Resources needed for calculation.
| # Followings are keys in resources
| numb_node | Integer | 1 | Node count required for the job
| task_per_node | Integer | 4 | Number of CPU cores required
| numb_gpu | Integer | Integer | 4 | Number of GPUs required
| manual_cuda_devices | Interger | 1 | Used with key "manual_cuda_multiplicity" specify the gpu number
| manual_cuda_multiplicity |Interger | 5 | Used in 01.model_devi,used with key "manual_cuda_devices" specify the MD program number running on one GPU  at the same time,dpgen will  automatically allocate MD jobs on different GPU. This can improve GPU usage for GPU like V100.
| node_cpu | Integer | 4 | Only for LSF. The number of CPU cores on each node that should be allocated to the job.
| new_lsf_gpu | Boolean | false | **Only for LSF.** Control whether new syntax of GPU to be enabled. If enabled, DP-GEN will generate line like `#BSUB -gpu num=1:mode=shared:j_exclusive=yes` in job submission script. Only support LSF>=10.1.0.3, and `LSB_GPU_NEW_SYNTAX=Y` should be set. Default: `false`.
| exclusive | Boolean | false | **Only for LSF, and only take effect when `new_lsf_gpu` enabled.** Control whether enable `j_exclusive` during running. Default: `false`.
| source_list | List of string | "....../vasp.env" | Environment needed for certain job. For example, if "env" is in the list, 'source env' will be written in the script.
| module_list | List of string | [ "Intel/2018", "Anaconda3"] | For example, If "Intel/2018" is in the list, "module load Intel/2018" will be written in the script.
| partition | String  | "AdminGPU" | Partition / queue in which to run the job. |
| time_limit | String (time format) | 23:00:00 | Maximal time permitted for the job |
mem_limit | Interger | 16 | Maximal memory permitted to apply for the job.
| with_mpi | Boolean | true | Deciding whether to use mpi for calculation. If it's true and machine type is Slurm, "srun" will be prefixed to `command` in the script.
| qos | "string"| "bigdata" | Deciding priority, dependent on particular settings of your HPC.
| allow_failure | Boolean | false | Allow the command to return a non-zero exit code.
| # End of resources
| command | String | "lmp_serial" | Executable path of software, such as `lmp_serial`, `lmp_mpi` and `vasp_gpu`, `vasp_std`, etc.
| group_size | Integer | 5 | DP-GEN will put these jobs together in one submitting script.
| user_forward_files | List of str | ["/path_to/vdw_kernel.bindat"] | These files will be uploaded in each calculation task. You should make sure provide the path exists. 
| user_backward_files | List of str | ["HILLS"] | Besides DP-GEN's normal output, these files will be downloaded after each calculation. You should make sure these files can be generated.

## Troubleshooting
1. The most common problem is whether two settings correspond with each other, including:
    - The order of elements in `type_map` and `mass_map` and **`fp_pp_files`**.
    - Size of `init_data_sys` and `init_batch_size`.
    - Size of `sys_configs` and `sys_batch_size`.
    - Size of `sel_a` and actual types of atoms in your system.
    - Index of `sys_configs` and `sys_idx`

2. Please verify the directories of `sys_configs`. If there isnt's any POSCAR for `01.model_devi` in one iteration, it may happen that you write the false path of `sys_configs`.
3. Correct format of JSON file.
4. In `02.fp`, total cores you require through `task_per_node` should be devided by `npar` times `kpar`.
5. The frames of one system should be larger than `batch_size` and `numb_test` in `default_training_param`. It happens that one iteration adds only a few structures and causes error in next iteration's training. In this condition, you may let `fp_task_min` be larger than `numb_test`.
